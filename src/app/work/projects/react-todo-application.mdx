## Overview

I developed a modern todo application that goes beyond basic functionality to demonstrate best practices in React development. The project showcases my proficiency with React hooks, TypeScript, state management, and creating intuitive user interfaces that enhance productivity.

## Key Features

- **Categorized Tasks**: Organization of todos by project, priority, and status
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive reordering and prioritization of tasks
- **Rich Text Editing**: Support for formatted notes within tasks
- **Recurring Tasks**: Implementation of repeating todos with customizable schedules
- **Data Visualization**: Charts showing task completion metrics and productivity insights
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without an internet connection with background syncing
- **Dark/Light Themes**: User preference-based UI theming with system detection

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Styled Components
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Backend & Authentication**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with accessibility focus
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to Vercel

## Technical Implementation

- Implemented a custom hook system for managing todos and their relationships
- Created an optimistic UI that updates immediately before server confirmation
- Built a responsive design that works seamlessly from mobile to desktop
- Developed accessible components following WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Used TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the application

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented virtualized lists to handle hundreds of todos without performance degradation
2. **State Synchronization**: Developed a robust syncing system that handles offline edits and conflict resolution
3. **Complex UI Interactions**: Created an intuitive drag-and-drop system with subtle animations and feedback
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Built comprehensive test suites to ensure reliability across various usage patterns

## Design Philosophy

This project was guided by several key principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Creating an interface that feels intuitive despite complex underlying functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with core functionality and layering in advanced features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a consistent experience across all device sizes
- **Performance Focus**: Optimizing for speed and responsiveness even with large datasets

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced my expertise in:
- Structuring React applications for maintainability and scalability
- Implementing advanced hooks patterns and custom hook composition
- Building applications with offline-first capabilities
- Creating accessible interfaces that work for all users
