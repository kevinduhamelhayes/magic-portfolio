## Overview

Leveraging my unique background in both electrical systems and software development, I created an AI-powered predictive maintenance system. This project combines real-time sensor data analysis with machine learning to predict potential equipment failures before they occur, demonstrating the practical application of AI in industrial settings.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Developed a Python-based system that collects and processes sensor data in real-time using FastAPI and WebSocket connections.
- **AI Prediction Model**: Implemented a custom machine learning pipeline using TensorFlow and scikit-learn for anomaly detection and failure prediction.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built a responsive React/Next.js dashboard with Tailwind CSS for real-time monitoring and maintenance scheduling.
- **API Integration**: Created a robust REST API system that handles data collection, processing, and distribution to various system components.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI, Django), Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, LangChain
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Docker, AWS (EC2, S3)

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was creating a reliable prediction system that could handle various types of industrial equipment. I solved this by:

1. Implementing a flexible data collection system that adapts to different sensor types
2. Developing a modular AI architecture that can be trained on equipment-specific data
3. Creating an efficient data pipeline that handles real-time processing without performance degradation

## Impact and Results

- Reduced equipment downtime by 35% through early problem detection
- Decreased maintenance costs by 25% by optimizing maintenance schedules
- Improved maintenance team efficiency by providing clear, actionable insights
- Successfully deployed across multiple industrial facilities

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrated the power of combining domain knowledge with modern technology. The experience reinforced the importance of:

- Building scalable, maintainable systems that can handle real-time data
- Creating intuitive interfaces for complex technical systems
- Implementing robust error handling and system monitoring
- Balancing technical capabilities with practical business needs
