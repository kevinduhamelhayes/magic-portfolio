## Overview

I developed a complete point-of-sale system using Electron.js to create a cross-platform desktop application for small retail businesses. This project was designed to provide an affordable, user-friendly alternative to expensive commercial POS solutions, with a focus on simplicity and reliability for everyday use in stores, kiosks, and small shops.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Sales Interface**: Created a streamlined checkout process with barcode scanning support, quick product lookup, and multiple payment methods.
- **Inventory Management**: Implemented a complete inventory system with stock tracking, low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- **Sales Reporting**: Developed comprehensive reporting features including daily/monthly sales summaries, product performance metrics, and export capabilities to Excel.
- **Multi-User Support**: Built a role-based access control system allowing different permission levels for owners, managers, and cashiers.
- **Offline Functionality**: Designed the system to work fully offline with local data storage, syncing when connection is available.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend & Backend**: Electron.js, JavaScript, Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap for responsive interface components
- **Additional Tools**: Electron-builder for packaging and distribution
- **Export Functionality**: ExcelJS for report generation

## Technical Implementation

- Utilized Electron's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for secure communication between renderer and main processes
- Implemented a modular architecture separating UI, business logic, and data access layers
- Created a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- Developed custom print functionality for receipts and reports
- Implemented efficient database queries to handle large product catalogs and sales history

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Performance Optimization**: Resolved initial performance issues with large datasets by implementing indexed queries and pagination strategies.
2. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensured consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux by creating an abstraction layer for platform-specific functionality.
3. **Secure Data Handling**: Implemented robust data validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
4. **Barcode Integration**: Developed custom drivers for various barcode scanner models to ensure seamless integration regardless of hardware.

## Business Impact

- Reduced checkout time by approximately 40% compared to previous manual processes
- Decreased inventory discrepancies by 65% through automated tracking
- Enabled data-driven business decisions through comprehensive sales analytics
- Provided an affordable solution accessible to small businesses with limited technology budgets

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of:
- Designing software with the specific needs of end-users in mind
- Building systems that are resilient and can operate in environments with unreliable connectivity
- Creating interfaces that require minimal training for daily operation
- Balancing feature richness with simplicity and performance
