## Overview

I developed a Stripe Payment Dashboard that provides businesses with a centralized platform to manage transactions, analyze payment patterns, and handle customer subscriptions. This solution bridges the gap between Stripe's powerful API and business users who need accessible financial insights without technical expertise.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of payments, refunds, and disputes
- **Subscription Management**: Tools for managing recurring revenue streams and customer plans
- **Advanced Analytics**: Visual representations of revenue trends, conversion rates, and customer lifetime value
- **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled financial reports with customizable metrics and KPIs
- **Customer Insights**: Detailed profiles with payment history and behavioral patterns
- **Multi-currency Support**: Handling of international payments with automatic currency conversion

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API integration
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts, D3.js
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with role-based access control
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transaction records and user data
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, AWS Lambda for serverless functions

## Technical Implementation

- Implemented Stripe webhook handlers to process and record payment events in real-time
- Created a secure authentication system with role-based permissions for financial data
- Developed optimized database queries for generating complex financial reports
- Built a responsive UI that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- Integrated with Stripe Connect to support marketplace payment distribution

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Security & Compliance**: Implemented PCI-compliant data handling practices and end-to-end encryption for sensitive financial information
2. **Real-time Updates**: Used WebSockets to provide instant notifications of transaction events
3. **Data Aggregation**: Created efficient algorithms for processing and summarizing large volumes of transaction data
4. **Error Handling**: Developed robust systems for transaction reconciliation and detecting payment anomalies

## Business Impact

- Reduced payment reconciliation time by 75% through automated transaction matching
- Increased subscription renewal rates by 18% with proactive management tools
- Provided actionable insights that helped businesses optimize pricing strategies
- Streamlined financial operations by centralizing payment management

## Key Learnings

This project deepened my expertise in:
- Financial technology integration and payment processing systems
- Creating secure applications that handle sensitive customer and payment data
- Developing intuitive dashboards that translate complex data into actionable business insights
- Building systems that scale with transaction volume while maintaining performance
