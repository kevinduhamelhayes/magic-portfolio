## Overview

As part of my work with Kraken Market, I led the development of a modern e-commerce platform that combines traditional commerce functionality with advanced AI features. The platform was designed to provide a seamless shopping experience while incorporating intelligent features for both customers and administrators.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Implemented a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and natural language processing to suggest products based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Advanced Search System**: Developed an intelligent search engine with auto-complete and semantic search capabilities using vector embeddings.
- **Real-time Inventory Management**: Created a real-time inventory tracking system with predictive restocking notifications.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated multiple payment gateways including Stripe and local payment methods, with fraud detection capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis for caching
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for client-side predictions, Python scikit-learn for backend analytics
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API, Local payment gateways

## Technical Implementation

- Utilized Next.js 14's server components and streaming for optimal performance
- Implemented a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability
- Created a robust error handling system with automatic recovery mechanisms
- Developed a comprehensive admin dashboard for inventory and order management

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenges included:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented aggressive caching strategies and lazy loading techniques to maintain fast page loads even with large product catalogs.
2. **Data Consistency**: Developed a robust synchronization system between the inventory management system and the customer-facing storefront.
3. **Payment Security**: Created a secure payment processing system with multiple layers of fraud detection and prevention.

## Results and Impact

- Increased conversion rate by 45% through improved user experience and personalized recommendations
- Reduced cart abandonment rate by 30% with streamlined checkout process
- Improved inventory turnover by 25% using AI-powered stock predictions
- Successfully scaled to handle 10,000+ daily active users

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights into:

- Building scalable e-commerce systems that can handle high traffic
- Implementing AI features that provide real business value
- Creating secure payment processing systems
- Managing complex state in large-scale applications
