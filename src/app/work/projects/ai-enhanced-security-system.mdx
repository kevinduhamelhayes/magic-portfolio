## Overview

Drawing from my experience at Prosegur S.A, I developed an AI-enhanced security system that modernizes traditional security infrastructure. This project bridges the gap between conventional security systems and cutting-edge AI technology, creating a more intelligent and responsive security solution for data centers and critical facilities.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Threat Detection**: Implemented computer vision algorithms for real-time threat detection and classification.
- **Automated Response System**: Developed an automated incident response system that coordinates with existing security protocols.
- **Data Center Monitoring**: Created specialized monitoring solutions for data center environments, including temperature and access control systems.
- **Integration Platform**: Built a unified platform that connects various security subsystems through a centralized management interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Services**: Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend Interface**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML Components**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Custom Vision Models
- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
- **Database Systems**: TimescaleDB for time-series data, PostgreSQL for general data
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes for deployment

## Technical Details

- Implemented real-time video processing with optimized ML models
- Created a scalable architecture for handling multiple security feeds
- Developed custom algorithms for anomaly detection in security patterns
- Integrated with existing security protocols and emergency response systems

## Challenges and Solutions

The project presented several unique challenges:

1. **System Integration**: Successfully integrated new AI capabilities with legacy security systems through custom middleware solutions.
2. **Real-time Processing**: Optimized the processing pipeline to handle multiple data streams without latency.
3. **Reliability**: Implemented redundant systems and failover mechanisms to ensure 24/7 operation.
4. **Compliance**: Ensured all solutions met strict security and privacy requirements.

## Results and Impact

- Reduced false alarm rates by 75% through improved detection accuracy
- Decreased incident response time by 60%
- Improved overall security system efficiency by 40%
- Successfully deployed across multiple high-security facilities

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights into:

- Integrating modern AI solutions with traditional security infrastructure
- Building highly reliable systems for critical environments
- Managing real-time data processing at scale
- Implementing secure and compliant solutions
