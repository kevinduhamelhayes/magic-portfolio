OpenAI announced today GPT-4.5, the latest version of its language model that powers ChatGPT. This update, initially available as a preview for paying users, comes loaded with notable improvements that make it more powerful, efficient, and user-friendly than its predecessor GPT-4.

## ðŸ”‘ Key improvements over GPT-4:

**More natural and empathetic conversations:** GPT-4.5 "feels" more human during dialogue. It offers warmer and more intuitive interactions, better capturing the subtleties of language and user intent.

**Greater understanding and knowledge base:** The new version significantly expands its knowledge of the world and follows user instructions with greater precision.

**Fewer "hallucinations" and more reliable responses:** A more scaled unsupervised learning approach has resulted in a model that makes fewer factual errors. GPT-4.5 is much less likely to invent data or confuse information, an area where evolution has been particularly notable according to early tests.

**Better performance and efficiency:** Beyond being smarter, GPT-4.5 has gained in efficiency. In some technical domains (logical reasoning, mathematics, programming), it performs up to 10% better than the original GPT-4.

## ðŸ¤– GPT-4.5 compared to other current models:

**Anthropic Claude:** Claude is one of the main competitors, known for handling extremely long conversations thanks to a giant context window (it can process up to ~100,000 text tokens, equivalent to tens of thousands of words, in a single request).

**Google Gemini:** Google's bet on generative AI is Gemini, already in its second generation by late 2024. Unlike GPT-4.5 (focused on dialogue), Gemini 2.0 is oriented toward "autonomous" virtual agents: models that not only converse but can perform actions for the user with human supervision.

## ðŸ’¡ Applications and potential industry impact:

Thanks to these improvements, GPT-4.5
